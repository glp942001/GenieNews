## API Testing (Optional)

### Test Article Summary Endpoint

```bash
# Get an article ID from your database first
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat/summary/1/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "article_id": 1,
  "title": "Article Title",
  "source": "Source Name",
  "url": "https://...",
  "sections": {
    "what": "Explanation of what happened...",
    "why_it_matters": "Why this is significant...",
    "takeaway": "Key takeaway..."
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T..."
}
```

### Test Chat Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat/message/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What are the top stories?"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "Based on today's curated articles, here are the top stories: ...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T..."
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No articles available"
**Solution**: Run article ingestion and curation:
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py update_rss_feeds
python manage.py test_curation
```

### Issue: "OpenAI API error"
**Solution**: Check your `.env` file has valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Issue: Chat doesn't open when clicking âœ¨
**Solution**: 
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify frontend dev server is running
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue: Summaries take too long
**Solution**: This is normal - OpenAI API calls take 2-5 seconds. You can:
- Use a faster model (change `AI_MODEL` in settings.py)
- Reduce `max_tokens` in ai_service.py

### Issue: "CORS error" in console
**Solution**: Backend settings.py already has CORS configured. Restart backend server.
