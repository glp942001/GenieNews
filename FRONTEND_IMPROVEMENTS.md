# Frontend Improvements - Enhanced Article Excerpts

## What Was Changed

### 1. **API Service Enhancement** (`frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- **Before**: Used only `summary_short` (1-2 sentences)
- **After**: Prioritizes `summary_detailed` (3-4 paragraphs) for rich excerpts
- **Fallback**: Still uses `summary_short` if detailed summary unavailable
- **Result**: Much longer, more engaging article previews

### 2. **NewsCard Component Improvements** (`frontend/src/components/news/NewsCard.jsx`)

#### Typography & Layout
- **Font Sizes**: Increased excerpt text sizes for better readability
  - Large cards: `text-sm` (was `text-xs`)
  - Medium cards: `text-xs` (was `text-[11px]`)
  - Small cards: `text-[11px]` (was `text-[10px]`)

#### Visual Design
- **Background**: Added subtle gray background (`bg-gray-50`) to excerpt areas
- **Padding**: Added padding (`p-2` or `p-3`) for better spacing
- **Rounded Corners**: Added `rounded-lg` for modern look
- **Call-to-Action**: Enhanced "Read more..." with purple color and arrow
- **Line Clamping**: Increased line limits for more content:
  - Large: 8-10 lines (was 6-8)
  - Medium: 6-7 lines (was 4-5)
  - Small: 5-6 lines (was 4)

#### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Effects**: Added subtle scale animation (`hover:scale-[1.02]`)
- **Group Classes**: Added for coordinated hover effects
- **Better Spacing**: Added `space-y-2` for consistent vertical rhythm

### 3. **Content Strategy**
- **AI-Generated Summaries**: Now using GPT-3.5-turbo's detailed summaries
- **Rich Context**: 3-4 paragraph excerpts instead of single sentences
- **Better Engagement**: Users get much more information before clicking
