# AI Audio News Segment - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented an AI-generated daily audio news segment feature that converts the top 8 curated articles into a professional 5-minute radio-style broadcast using OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes ✅

1. **Media Storage Configuration**
   - Added `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` to `settings.py`
   - Created `/backend/media/audio_segments/` directory for audio file storage
   - Configured Django to serve media files in development

2. **Database Model**
   - Created `AudioSegment` model with fields:
     - `date`: Unique date field for daily caching
     - `audio_file`: FileField storing the MP3 audio
     - `script_text`: Full transcript of the news segment
     - `article_ids`: JSON array of article IDs included
     - `duration_seconds`: Approximate duration
     - `created_at`: Timestamp
   - Applied migrations successfully

3. **AI Service Extensions**
   - `generate_news_script()`: Creates professional radio-style script from articles
     - Intro, 8 article segments, outro format
     - ~4000-5000 characters for 5-minute broadcast
   - `generate_audio_from_script()`: Converts script to audio using OpenAI TTS
     - Uses `tts-1-hd` model for high quality
     - Uses "alloy" voice (professional, clear)
     - Saves audio as MP3 file

4. **API Endpoint**
   - `GET /api/audio/daily-segment/`
   - Returns cached audio if exists for today
   - Generates new audio if not cached
   - Response includes:
     - `audio_url`: Full URL to MP3 file
     - `script_text`: Full transcript
     - `article_count`: Number of articles covered
     - `duration_seconds`: Estimated duration
     - `cached`: Whether this was cached or newly generated

5. **Django Admin Integration**
   - Registered `AudioSegment` model in admin
   - Custom admin interface with:
     - Audio player preview
     - Script preview with scroll
     - Article count and duration display
     - Date-based filtering

### Frontend Changes ✅

1. **API Service Function**
   - Added `generateDailyAudioSegment()` to `api.js`
   - Handles API calls and error states
   - Returns structured response data

2. **AudioPlayer Component**
   - Replaced `VideoPlayer.jsx` with new `AudioPlayer.jsx`
   - Features:
     - **Generate Button**: Triggers audio generation
     - **Loading State**: Shows progress during generation (20-30 seconds)
     - **HTML5 Audio Player**: Native browser audio controls
     - **Transcript Toggle**: Show/hide full script text
     - **Download Button**: Download MP3 file
     - **Regenerate Button**: Force regeneration of today's audio
     - **Error Handling**: Graceful error display with retry
     - **Toast Notifications**: Success/error feedback
   - Beautiful purple gradient design matching app theme

3. **NewsGrid Integration**
   - Updated to use `AudioPlayer` instead of `VideoPlayer`
   - Maintained same layout and positioning

## Cost Estimate

### Per Audio Generation:
- **Script Generation (GPT-4)**: ~$0.03-0.06
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS HD)**: ~$0.15-0.20
- **Total per segment**: ~$0.18-0.26

### With Daily Caching:
- **Per month (30 days)**: $5.40-7.80
- **Per year (365 days)**: $65.70-94.90

**Extremely affordable** compared to video generation (100-200x cheaper!)

## How to Test

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd /Users/gregoriolozano/Desktop/GenieNews
source venv/bin/activate
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Start Frontend Server
```bash
cd /Users/gregoriolozano/Desktop/GenieNews/frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Feature
1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
2. You should see the Audio Player component at the top (purple gradient background)
3. Click "Generate Audio News" button
4. Wait 20-30 seconds for generation
5. Audio player will appear with controls
6. Test features:
   - Play the audio
   - Show/hide transcript
   - Download the MP3
   - Regenerate audio

### 4. Verify Caching
1. Refresh the page
2. Click "Generate Audio News" again
3. Should return instantly (cached response)
4. Toast message will say "loaded from cache"

### 5. Check Django Admin
1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/`
2. Navigate to "Audio segments"
3. View today's generated segment
4. Play audio directly in admin
5. View script preview

## Troubleshooting

### If audio generation fails:
1. **Check OpenAI API Key**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in backend `.env`
2. **Check Articles**: Verify you have at least 1 curated article in database
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure `backend/media/audio_segments/` is writable
4. **Check Logs**: Look at Django server logs for error details

### If audio doesn't play:
1. **Check File Exists**: Verify MP3 file exists in `backend/media/audio_segments/`
2. **Check URL**: Ensure `MEDIA_URL` is properly configured
3. **Check CORS**: Ensure frontend can access backend media files
4. **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors
