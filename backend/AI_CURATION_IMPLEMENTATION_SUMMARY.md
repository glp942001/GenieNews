## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Core AI Processing

- ✅ **Dual Summary Generation**
  - Short (1-2 sentences) for feed cards
  - Detailed (3-4 paragraphs) for full articles
  - GPT-4 powered with focused prompts

- ✅ **Relevance Scoring (0-1 scale)**
  - Hybrid approach: 30% keyword + 70% AI semantic analysis
  - Focused on AI/technology topics
  - Color-coded in admin (green/orange/red)

- ✅ **Tag Extraction**
  - Specific technical tags (e.g., "GPT-4", "computer-vision")
  - 3-8 tags per article
  - Avoids generic terms

- ✅ **Vector Embeddings**
  - 1536-dimensional vectors via text-embedding-3-small
  - Stored in pgvector database
  - Ready for semantic search

- ✅ **Cover Media Selection**
  - Automatically selects first image from article
  - Links to MediaAsset objects

### Automation & Scheduling

- ✅ **Auto-Trigger After Ingestion**
  - `ingest_single_feed_task` automatically calls curation
  - Only triggers when new articles created
  - Configurable batch size

- ✅ **Hourly Scheduled Task**
  - Celery Beat runs curation every hour
  - Catches any missed articles
  - Configurable in settings

### Error Handling & Resilience

- ✅ **Retry Logic**
  - Exponential backoff for rate limits
  - 3 retry attempts per API call
  - Graceful degradation

- ✅ **Fallback Mechanisms**
  - Failed summaries → Use original content
  - Failed relevance → Default to 0.5
  - Failed tags → Extract from title
  - Failed embeddings → Zero vector
  - Processing continues despite individual failures

### Admin Interface

- ✅ **Enhanced Article Display**
  - Visual curation status
  - Quick identification of pending articles
  - Batch curation actions

- ✅ **Rich Curated Article View**
  - Color-coded scores
  - Styled tag badges
  - Collapsible embedding info
  - Summary previews
  - Cross-links to raw articles

### Testing & Debugging

- ✅ **Test Management Command**
  - `python manage.py test_curation --latest`
  - Shows all AI outputs without saving
  - Perfect for validation and debugging

- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**
  - Per-article progress
  - Timing information
  - Error details
  - Success/failure counts

## 📊 Configuration

All settings are environment-variable driven:

```bash
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
AI_MODEL=gpt-4
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.3
AI_MAX_TOKENS=1000

# Curation
AI_RELEVANCE_KEYWORDS=artificial intelligence,machine learning,...
AI_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=0.3
AI_BATCH_SIZE=20
```

Easy to customize per environment (dev/staging/prod).

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Run setup script
cd backend
./setup_ai_curation.sh

# 2. Add your OpenAI API key when prompted

# 3. Test the system
python manage.py test_curation --latest

# 4. Curate articles
python manage.py shell
>>> from news.tasks import curate_articles_task
>>> curate_articles_task()

# 5. View results
python manage.py runserver
# Visit http://localhost:8000/admin/news/articlecurated/
```

## 💰 Cost Optimization

The system is designed to be cost-effective:

1. **Smart Filtering**: Skips AI calls for obviously irrelevant articles (keyword score < 0.1)
2. **Configurable Model**: Switch to GPT-3.5-turbo for 10x cost reduction
3. **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch size to control costs
4. **No Re-processing**: ArticleCurated records are permanent
5. **Text Truncation**: Automatically limits input tokens

Estimated costs:
- GPT-4: ~$0.03-0.06 per article
- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.003 per article
- Embeddings: ~$0.0001 per article

## 🔄 Integration Points

### With Feed Ingestion
- Automatically triggered after `ingest_single_feed_task`
- Seamless pipeline: Ingest → Curate → Ready for frontend

### With REST API
- ArticleCurated already exposed via `/api/news/articles/`
- Frontend can filter by relevance score
- Supports ordering and pagination

### With Frontend
Ready to use in frontend:
- `summary_short` for cards
- `summary_detailed` for full view
- `ai_tags` for filtering
- `relevance_score` for ranking
- `cover_media` for thumbnails

## 📈 Performance

- Batch processing: ~20 articles in 30-60 seconds (depends on API response time)
- Rate limiting: Configurable delays between requests
- Async processing: Uses Celery for non-blocking execution
- Scalable: Can process thousands of articles

## 🛡️ Production Readiness
