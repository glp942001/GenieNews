# Audio Generation Improvements - Quick Summary

## ‚úÖ All Improvements Complete!

Your AI audio news generation has been significantly enhanced with personality, humor, storytelling, better pacing, and configurable voice settings.

## What Changed

### 1. üé≠ **Script Generation - Added Personality & Storytelling**
   - Changed from "professional list reader" to "engaging radio personality"
   - Added humor, clever observations, and conversational tone
   - Stories now lead with "wow factor" instead of dry facts
   - Natural transitions: "Now here's something wild...", "But wait, there's more..."
   - Rhetorical questions and reactions: "Wild, right?", "Get this..."

### 2. ‚è∏Ô∏è **Better Pacing & Natural Pauses**
   - Added automatic pause enhancement (`_enhance_script_pacing()`)
   - Pauses after sentences, questions, and exclamations
   - Pauses at commas for natural breathing
   - Slower speech speed (0.95 instead of 1.0)
   - Varied sentence structures for rhythm

### 3. üé§ **Voice Configuration**
   - Attempting "maple" voice (with fallback to "nova")
   - Easy configuration via environment variables
   - No code editing needed to change voices!

### 4. ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration-Based Settings**
   - New Django settings for TTS
   - Change voice/speed in `.env` file
   - Settings persist across restarts

## Quick Setup

### Try "Maple" Voice (or any other voice)

1. **Edit your `.env` file** (create if it doesn't exist in `backend/` directory):
   ```bash
   # Text-to-Speech Configuration
   TTS_VOICE=nova              # Try: nova, alloy, echo, fable, onyx, shimmer
   TTS_SPEED=0.95             # Slower = more pausing (0.25-4.0)
   TTS_MODEL=tts-1-hd         # High quality
   ```

2. **If trying "maple"** (may not be available yet in TTS API):
   ```bash
   TTS_VOICE=maple
   ```
   If it fails, the system automatically falls back to "nova"

3. **Restart Django** (if running):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Generate New Audio

```bash
cd backend

# Option 1: Via Python Shell
python manage.py shell
>>> from news.tasks import generate_audio_segment_task
>>> result = generate_audio_segment_task()
>>> print(result)

# Option 2: Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/news/audio/generate/

# Option 3: Via Test Script
python test_audio_generation.py
```

## Testing Different Voices

Want to experiment? Try each voice to find your favorite:

```bash
# In backend/.env, change TTS_VOICE to:

TTS_VOICE=nova      # Warm, engaging female (recommended!) ‚≠ê
TTS_VOICE=alloy     # Neutral, balanced
TTS_VOICE=echo      # Male voice
TTS_VOICE=fable     # Expressive, British-accented
TTS_VOICE=onyx      # Deep, authoritative male
TTS_VOICE=shimmer   # Soft, gentle
```

Then regenerate audio to hear the difference!

## Speed Adjustments

If audio is too slow or too fast:

```bash
TTS_SPEED=1.0    # Normal speed
TTS_SPEED=0.95   # Current: 5% slower (better pacing)
TTS_SPEED=0.90   # 10% slower (more dramatic pauses)
TTS_SPEED=1.05   # 5% faster (more energetic)
```

## Files Modified

```
backend/news/ai_service.py
  ‚úì Enhanced generate_news_script() prompt (lines 633-674)
  ‚úì Updated system prompt for creativity (line 680)
  ‚úì Added _enhance_script_pacing() method (lines 704-722)
  ‚úì Updated generate_audio_from_script() (lines 724-767)
  ‚úì Added TTS settings to __init__ (lines 38-41)

backend/genienews_backend/settings.py
  ‚úì Added TTS configuration settings (lines 219-222)

backend/ENV_SETUP_NOTE.txt
  ‚úì Added TTS settings documentation
```

## Expected Improvements

### Before üòê
- ‚ùå Monotone delivery
- ‚ùå Sounds like reading bullet points
- ‚ùå No pauses between sentences
- ‚ùå Dry, robotic tone

### After üéâ
- ‚úÖ Dynamic, engaging delivery
- ‚úÖ Story-driven narratives
- ‚úÖ Natural pauses and rhythm
- ‚úÖ Personality, humor, storytelling
- ‚úÖ Sounds like talking to a friend!

## Example Script Changes

**Old Style:**
```
"Welcome to today's AI news. OpenAI has released a new model. 
It features improved capabilities. The model is now available to users."
```

**New Style:**
```
"Hey there! So... OpenAI just dropped something pretty incredible. 
Remember when we thought GPT-4 was mind-blowing? Well... get this. 
Their latest model takes things to a whole new level. And here's 
the kicker... it's live right now!"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Maple" voice not working?
Don't worry! The system automatically falls back to "nova" which is also great. 
Check logs for: `Voice 'maple' not available, falling back to 'nova'`

### Audio still sounds monotone?
Try these:
1. Regenerate audio (old audio used old settings)
2. Try different voice: `fable` or `nova` are most expressive
3. Increase pause enhancement in `_enhance_script_pacing()`

### Want more/less humor?
Adjust temperature in `ai_service.py` line 683:
```python
temperature=0.8,  # Higher = more creative (0.7-0.9 range)
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Generate new audio segment with improvements
2. ‚úÖ Listen and compare to previous version
3. ‚úÖ Experiment with different voices
4. ‚úÖ Fine-tune speed if needed
5. ‚úÖ Enjoy your engaging AI newscaster!

## Voice Notes

**"Maple" Status:** This voice is mentioned in ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode but 
may not be available in the standard TTS API yet. Your code is ready for it - 
as soon as OpenAI adds it to the API, it will work!

**Current Best:** "Nova" - warm, engaging, great personality ‚≠ê
