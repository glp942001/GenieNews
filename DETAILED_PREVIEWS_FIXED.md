# âœ… Detailed Previews Fixed!

## Problem Identified
The frontend was only showing 1-2 sentence summaries because the Django API serializer was only returning `summary_short` instead of `summary_detailed`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Backend Fix** (`backend/news/serializers.py`)
- **Added** `summary_detailed` field to `ArticleCuratedListSerializer`
- **Before**: Only returned `summary_short` (1-2 sentences)
- **After**: Now returns both `summary_short` AND `summary_detailed` (3-4 paragraphs)

### 2. **Frontend Already Configured** (`frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- The frontend was already set up to prioritize `summary_detailed` over `summary_short`
- API transformation logic was correct, just needed the backend to provide the data

### 3. **Server Restart**
- Restarted Django server to pick up serializer changes
- API now returns detailed summaries

## Results

### Before Fix:
- **Short Summary**: 182 characters (1-2 sentences)
- **Frontend Display**: Single sentence previews

### After Fix:
- **Detailed Summary**: 1,725 characters (3-4 paragraphs)
- **Frontend Display**: Rich, engaging excerpts like a real newspaper

## Example Content

**Short Summary (182 chars):**
> "A new framework called Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) developed by Stanford University and SambaNova addresses context collapse in AI agents, improving performance and efficiency."

**Detailed Summary (1,725 chars):**
> "Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) is a novel framework developed by Stanford University and SambaNova to tackle the challenge of context collapse in AI agents. ACE functions by treating the context window of large language model (LLM) applications as an evolving playbook, enabling the agent to create and refine strategies as it gains experience in its environment. This approach overcomes limitations of other context-engineering frameworks by preventing context degradation and outperforming existing methods in optimizing system prompts and managing agent memory. ACE's modular design, involving a Generator, Reflector, and Curator, allows for dynamic playbook updates without suffering from brevity bias or context collapse.

> The significance of ACE lies in its ability to enhance AI performance and efficiency in various tasks, from multi-turn reasoning to domain-specific analysis. By analyzing feedback from actions and environments, ACE builds effective contexts without the need for manually labeled data, a crucial aspect for self-improving AI systems. Notably, ACE has shown superior performance compared to strong baselines like GEPA and classic in-context learning, achieving average performance gains of 10.6% on agent tasks and 8.6% on domain-specific benchmarks. Furthermore, ACE's efficiency is highlighted by its lower latency and token requirements, demonstrating that scalable self-improvement can be achieved with higher accuracy and lower overhead. This framework opens up possibilities for businesses to deploy local models, protect sensitive data, and continuously refine context without the need for retraining weights, paving the way for dynamic and continuously improving AI systems in the future."

## Status: âœ… FIXED

**Your frontend now displays rich, detailed excerpts (3-4 paragraphs) instead of single sentences!**

**Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000 to see the improved previews!** ðŸŽ‰

## Files Modified

1. `backend/news/serializers.py` - Added `summary_detailed` to list serializer
2. Backend server restarted to apply changes

The detailed previews are now working as intended!
