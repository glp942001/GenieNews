```

**File size:** 4.0MB

## How This Speed Works

**Speed 1.15** means:
- 15% faster than normal speaking pace
- Still clear and understandable

This is the **sweet spot** between:
- Too slow (0.95) → felt sluggish
- Too fast (would be hard to follow)

## Adjusting Speed (If Needed)

If you want to fine-tune further, edit `backend/.env`:

# Faster (more energetic)
TTS_SPEED=1.2    # 20% faster → ~4.7 minutes

TTS_SPEED=1.15   # 15% faster → ~5.6 minutes ✓

# Slower (more dramatic)
TTS_SPEED=1.05   # 5% faster → ~6.3 minutes
```

Then regenerate:
```bash
cd backend
source ../venv/bin/activate
python manage.py shell -c "from news.tasks import generate_audio_segment_task; generate_audio_segment_task()"
```
